# Why Swiccy?
Swiccy started as an idea in the Christmas period, where people give presents to eachother.
In particular, in Italy you can receive some particular kinds of sweet breads called "Panettone" and "Pandoro".
Because I prefer Pandoro over Panettone, I was afraid of receiving too many Panettones and be forced to throw them away. So, I thought, why don't I create an online platform where to exchange my Panettone for a better and healthier and tastier Pandoro? That's it. There are no other reason. I was just hungry.

## The war between Pandoro and Panettone
Once upon a time, an italian pastry chef managed to prepare a new dessert for the king, made of a sweet bread, and since it was the color of gold, it got named "Pandoro" (Golden bread).
But the enemy empire eventually got to know about this new dessert, so they tried to copy the idea. To stop them, the king sent some undercover agents to mess up with the plan of the enemy. They were eventually able to pour in the pot some candied fruit and they altered the ingredients for the bread.
The final result was very different from the Pandoro. Indeed, the "Panettone" was born.
Since then, it is said that a war is still continuing today in Italy, between the supporters of the two factions.

# Ok but seriously, what is Swiccy?

Good, why don't you give them away in exchange for something else, instead of keeping them forever and never use them? There will surely be some fool... ehm, I mean, some kind soul that will give you something you like more!
